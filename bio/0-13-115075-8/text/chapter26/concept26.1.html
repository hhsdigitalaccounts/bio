<p>As you have read, most amphibians spend part of their life cycles in aquatic habitats, at least to lay their eggs. In contrast, the tetrapods known as amniotes&#151;reptiles, birds, and mammals&#151;are more completely adapted to living on land. Able to complete their life cycles without returning to water, amniotes diversified throughout land ecosystems, including the driest deserts.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Amniotes</span><br>
Reptiles, birds, and mammals together make up a vertebrate clade (evolutionary branch) called the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gamniote.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gamniote.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">amniotes</a>. Three key adaptations for life on land distinguish amniotes from most amphibians and fishes: the amniotic egg, internal fertilization, and water-tight skin.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Amniotic Egg</span> The adaptation for which the clade is named is the <a href="../../glossary/terms/a/gamnioti.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/a/gamnioti.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">amniotic egg</a>, a waterproof egg with a shell. The amniotic egg is named for one particular membrane&#151;the amnion&#151;formed by the developing embryo. The amnion protects the embryo from drying out and surrounds a fluid-filled cavity that cushions it (Figure 26-1). The other membranes formed during development of the embryo function in gas exchange, waste removal, and supplying nutrients. (Note that eggs also contain other membranes, such as the "skins" you'll observe in a chicken egg in Investigative Lab 26, that form before the egg is fertilized.)</p>

<p>The amniotic egg contrasts with the amphibian egg, which  lacks a shell and amnion and is not waterproof. Amphibians such as frogs must deposit their eggs in a pond or other wet place. The amniotic egg, with its self-contained "pond," makes it possible for the embryo to develop within an egg laid on land.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Internal Fertilization</span> In internal fertilization, the male deposits sperm within the female's body. The sperm then swim inside the reproductive tube toward the egg. This contrasts with external fertilization, which occurs in most fishes and amphibians. In external fertilization a large quantity of eggs is deposited in a watery environment. The sperm are then deposited nearby into the water, and they swim to the eggs. External fertilization would not work on land.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Water-tight Skin</span> Amniotes have water-tight skin enriched with a waterproofing protein called keratin. The "keratinized" skin prevents dehydration. Keratin is found in different structures in various amniotes. Reptile skin has <a href="../../glossary/terms/s/gscale.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/s/gscale.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">scales</a>, hard overlapping structures made of keratin. Birds have feathers made of keratin. In mammals, hair, nails, and horns are made of keratin. With water-tight skin, amniotes can maintain an internal environment that is mostly water even if the external environment is dry.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">General Characteristics of Reptiles</span><br>
Among amniotes, reptiles (traditionally called class Reptilia) are most easily recognized by their scaly skin. Turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodiles, and alligators are reptiles.</p> 

<p>Most reptiles lay eggs, although a few species give birth to live young. The eggshells of lizards and most snakes are leathery and flexible. The eggshells of other reptiles, such as turtles and crocodiles, are hard and thin.</p>

<p>As you have read, reptiles have water-tight skin covered in scales. Consequently, reptiles cannot exchange gases across their skin, as amphibians do. Instead, most reptiles rely entirely on lungs for breathing. Also, since a scaly skin cannot expand as an animal grows, many reptiles molt. Molting is the process in  which an animal sheds its skin as it grows. The shed skin is replaced by a new, larger skin.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard reptiles described as "cold blooded"? This common saying is somewhat inaccurate. Most reptiles do not actually have cold blood most of the time. However, reptiles do regulate their body temperatures differently than mammals do. The main source of body heat for most reptiles is their environment. Animals whose main source of body heat is the external environment are called <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gectothe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gectothe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">ectotherms</a>. Ectotherms do generate some metabolic heat, but they rely mainly on environmental heat. In contrast, most body heat for <a href="../../glossary/terms/e/gendothe.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/e/gendothe.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">endotherms</a>, such as birds and mammals, is generated from cell metabolism. However, most endotherms also use the environment to help regulate body temperature. For example, on a cool day a cat might nap in the sun instead of in the shade. As ectotherms, reptiles are even more dependent on such behavior to regulate their temperature. A desert lizard, for example, may move back and forth between sun and shade, maintaining a relatively stable, warm body temperature.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Reptiles of the Mesozoic Era</span><br>
The oldest reptile fossils have been found in rocks from the Carboniferous period (about 300 million years ago). Reptiles diversified greatly 55 million years later, in the Mesozoic Era. During that time, dinosaurs occupied many terrestrial habitats and ecological roles. Aquatic reptiles, such as plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, cruised the seas. Flying pterosaurs roamed the skies. In fact, reptiles were so widespread, numerous, and diverse that the Mesozoic Era is sometimes called the "Age of Reptiles."</p>


<p>For 150 million years, dinosaurs were the most diverse group of reptiles. Dinosaurs were mostly land-dwellers that walked upright on their hind legs. They ranged in size from as small as a hamster to larger than a whale. Some dinosaurs were the largest animals ever to inhabit land. Most dinosaurs ate plants. However, there were also many carnivores, including species that chased prey by running on their hind legs. There is evidence that some predators hunted in packs and attacked prey larger than themselves.</p>

<p>New discoveries are constantly changing how biologists think of dinosaurs. For example, dinosaurs used to be thought of as slow, sluggish creatures. However, there is increasing evidence that many dinosaurs were quick and agile. Most highly active animals living today, such as birds and mammals, are endotherms. If some dinosaurs were quick and active, were they also endothermic? Dinosaurs were very diverse with many different body forms. They may have had a number of different body temperature adaptations&#151; perhaps including some that are no longer present among reptiles today. It is possible that at least one group of dinosaurs was endothermic. That group could have included the ancestor of birds.</p>

<p>The dominance of dinosaurs came to a relatively sudden end 65 million years ago. In Chapter 15, you read that scientists have found evidence of a collision between a large asteroid and Earth that may have contributed to the extinction of dinosaurs and many other forms of life. The fossil record also indicates that Earth's climate became cooler at the end of the Mesozoic Era. If most dinosaurs were ectothermic, the environment may have become too cold too quickly. This, as well as other possible changes, may have contributed to the mass extinction of dinosaurs.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Diversity of Living Reptiles</span><br>
There are about 6,500 known species of vertebrates traditionally referred to as reptiles. Three of the major orders of reptiles are turtles; lizards and snakes; and crocodiles and alligators (the crocodilians). In some classification schemes these orders are elevated to classes.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Turtles</span> Modern turtles (order Testudines) seem to be very much like fossil turtles, indicating that turtles have changed little since their origin in the Mesozoic Era. The most familiar physical characteristic of turtles is a large shell of bony plates covered by scales. The shell provides protection from predators. Not all turtle shells are hard, however. The shells of some aquatic turtles are soft and leathery. Another unusual feature of turtles is a jaw with horny ridges instead of teeth.</p>

<p>Turtles range in size from over 3 meters long and over 600 kilograms to under 12 centimeters and less than 1 kilogram. Many turtles are terrestrial (these are also called <i>tortoises</i>), while other turtles live in freshwater or marine environments. Some turtles, like the terrestrial Galápagos tortoises, eat mainly plants. Other turtles, such as the aquatic soft-shelled turtles, are mostly carnivores that eat fishes and invertebrates. </p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Lizards and Snakes</span> Lizards and snakes (order Squamata) are closely related. Many lizards, like the thorny devil, may look fierce and resemble your mental image of a dinosaur in miniature. However, fossil and DNA evidence indicate that lizards and snakes are not as closely related to the dinosaurs as are crocodilians.</p>

<p>The physical characteristics of most lizards include four legs, a tail, and scaly skin. The legs project outward from the body, and each foot has five toes. Lizards are ectotherms, and most species live in warm habitats. Insects make up the largest part of smaller lizards' diet, but a larger lizard such as a Komodo dragon can devour mammals the size of young deer. The large lizards called iguanas, including the green iguana that peers from this book's cover, are mostly plant eaters.</p>

<p>Snakes are legless reptiles with long, narrow bodies. As ectotherms, they mostly live in warm habitats. All snakes are carnivores&#151;they eat other animals. As predators, snakes have a number of adaptations that aid them in hunting and eating prey. Some snake species are poisonous. They have grooved or hollow fangs that deliver poison to their prey.</p>

<p><span class="setextsubsm">Crocodiles and Alligators</span> Together called the "crocodilians," crocodiles and alligators (order Crocodilia) are among the largest living reptiles. Some crocodiles grow longer than a full-sized car. Crocodilians spend most of their time in water breathing through turned-up nostrils. They can lie mostly hidden beneath the surface waiting to ambush prey that may approach the water's edge. Crocodiles and alligators are located in warm areas of Africa, Asia, Australia, and North and South America.</p>

<p>Extensive fossil evidence points to crocodiles as the living reptiles most closely related to dinosaurs. Though traditionally grouped with the lizards, snakes, and turtles as "reptiles," crocodilians are actually more closely related to birds. In fact, crocodilians have a four-chambered heart&#151;also a feature of birds as you will read in the next section. Of all the traditional "reptiles," crocodilians have the most highly developed brain. This more complex brain probably contributes to some of the complex social behavior observed in crocodilians. They conduct courting rituals, build nests, and care for their young. These behaviors are also common in birds, the closest living relatives of crocodilians.</p>
