<p>Have you ever seen exposed layers of rock alongside a highway? If the rock contains fossils, such layers are like pages in the history of life. Each layer records a snapshot of organisms from a particular time. Here, you'll explore how the story of life as told by fossils can be read.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">How Fossils Form</span><br>
In Chapter 14, you learned that fossils can form from the remains of organisms buried by sediments, dust, or volcanic ash. The soft body parts of dead organisms usually decay rapidly in these conditions. However, hard parts such as shells, bones, or teeth, are long-lasting and may become preserved as fossils. Many of these relics are hardened even more and preserved by chemical changes. Under the right conditions, minerals dissolved in groundwater seep into the tissues of a dead organism and replace its organic material. The plant or animal remains become petrified&#151;they turn to stone.</p>

<p>Some rare fossils actually retain organic material. Usually, these are found as thin films pressed between layers of sandstone or shale. For example, in Idaho, paleontologists have discovered plant leaves millions of years old that are still green with chlorophyll. DNA from such cells can sometimes be extracted and studied.</p>

<p>Other fossils consist of footprints, animal burrows, or other impressions left in sediments. Dinosaur tracks, for example, provide clues about whether the animal walked or ran and about its size and speed. Even animal dung can form fossils that give biologists clues to an animal's diet and digestive processes.</p>

<p>Sometimes an organism happens to die in a place where bacteria and fungi cannot decompose the corpse. In such rare cases, the entire body, including soft parts, may be preserved as a fossil. For example, mammoths, bison, and even prehistoric humans have been found frozen in ice, where conditions slow decomposition. Such rare discoveries make the news, but biologists rely mainly on fossils that are found in sedimentary rocks to reconstruct the history of life.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">The Fossil Record and Geologic Time Scale</span><br>
The fossil record is a rich storehouse of information about macroevolution. In each layer of rock, the fossils are samples of the organisms that existed in that place at the time the sediment was deposited. Geologists have studied and compared sediments from sites around the world. The data collected provide a consistent and extensive record of Earth's history.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../glossary/terms/g/ggeologi.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/g/ggeologi.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">geologic time scale</a> (Figure 15-18) organizes Earth's history into four distinct ages known as the Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic eras. These eras are divided into shorter time spans called periods. Periods are divided into epochs. The boundaries between eras are marked in the fossil record by a major change (or turnover) in the forms of life. For example, the beginning of the Paleozoic Era (the start of the Cambrian period) is marked by the appearance of a diversity of multicellular animals with hard parts. Fossils of these animals are absent in rocks of the Precambrian Era. The boundaries between eras and between some periods are also marked by widespread extinctions. For example, many of the animals that lived during the late Paleozoic Era became extinct at the end of that era.</p>

<p>Some of the organisms included in the geologic time scale may not be familiar to you now. But as you study Units 5, 6, and 7, you will learn more about these groups of organisms. When you read these later chapters, you may want to refer occasionally to Figure 15-18 to help you keep track of the "big picture" of the history of life.</p> 

<p><span class="setextsub">Dating Fossils</span><br>
Fossils aren't much help in learning about the past unless you know their age. Because younger sediments are usually layered over older ones, you can tell which layers formed before others. The <i>relative</i> ages of fossils reflect the order in which groups of species existed compared to one another. However, position in the rocks won't tell you the actual ages in years, or <i>absolute ages</i>, of the fossils. The situation is like peeling layers of wallpaper from the walls of an old house. You could determine the sequence in which the wallpapers had been applied, but not the year that each layer was added.</p> 

<p><a href="../../glossary/terms/r/gradiome.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/r/gradiome.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">Radiometric dating<a> is based on the measurement of certain radioactive isotopes in objects. It is the method most often used to determine the absolute ages of rocks and fossils. Every radioactive isotope has a fixed rate of decay. An isotope's <a href="../../glossary/terms/h/ghalflif.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/h/ghalflif.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">half-life</a> is the number of years it takes for 50 percent of the original sample to decay. The half-life is unaffected by temperature, pressure, and other environmental conditions.</p> 

<p>Geologists use radioactive isotopes with long half-lives to date rocks. For example, uranium-238, which has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, has been used to date rocks of the Precambrian era and the Cambrian period. Uranium-238 is not present in living organisms. It occurs in molten lava and volcanic rock that forms as lava cools. After volcanic rock forms, no more uranium-238 is incorporated. The rock's original stock of the isotope decays, eventually becoming lead-206. By measuring the ratio of uranium-238 to lead-206, researchers can date (find the absolute age of) volcanic rocks. Paleontologists can use these measurements to date fossils found in rock layers above or below the volcanic rocks (Figure 15-19).</p>

<p>Sometimes the ages of fossils themselves can be determined directly. Fossils contain isotopes of elements that accumulated in the organisms when they were alive&#151;for example, carbon-12 and radioactive carbon-14. Plants take in both isotopes in the carbon dioxide used for photosynthesis. Animals consume the isotopes in food. When an organism dies, this intake stops, but radioactive decay continues. Changes in the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 can be measured, allowing researchers to calculate how long the organism has been dead.</p> 

<p>"Carbon dating" can only be used to find the age of recent fossils because carbon-14 has a half-life of just 5,730 years. You can see from Figure 15-20 that if fossils are much older than about 50,000 years, the fraction of carbon-14 remaining is too small to measure accurately. To estimate the ages of older fossils, scientists can use surrounding rocks that contain uranium-238 and other radioactive isotopes having longer half-lives.</p>

<p><span class="setextsub">Continental Drift and Macroevolution</span><br>
Earth's continents are not locked in place. They move about the planet's surface like passengers on great plates of crust, floating on the hot mantle. Landmasses on different plates change position relative to each other as a result of movement known as <a href="../../glossary/terms/c/gcontine.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/c/gcontine.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">continental drift</a>. North America and Europe, for example, are presently drifting apart at a rate of about 2 centimeters per year.</p> 

<p>Continental drift is the solution to many biological puzzles. For example, paleontologists have discovered matching Mesozoic fossils in West Africa and Brazil. How could these two parts of the world, now separated by 3,000 kilometers of ocean, be home to the same organisms? The evidence makes sense if these two regions were part of one landmass in the early Mesozoic Era. Similarly, continental drift explains why the plants and animals of Australia are so different from those in the rest of the world. After Australia became an isolated landmass, the organisms living there would have evolved independently of those living on other continents.</p> 

<p>Two major events in the history of continental drift had an especially strong influence on life on Earth. The first occurred about 250 million years ago, near the end of the Paleozoic Era (Figure 15-21). Plate movements brought all the landmasses together into one supercontinent, named Pangaea (meaning "all land"). A variety of environmental changes followed. The amount of shoreline was reduced. Also, evidence suggests that sea levels dropped and shallow coastal seas were drained. Such changes would have destroyed the shallow water environments inhabited by many marine species. On land, continental interiors&#151;which are drier and have more extreme climates than coastal areas&#151;would have been affected as well. Additionally, species that had been evolving in isolation would have come together and competed. All these changes likely caused the extinction of huge numbers of species.</p>

						<p align="center"><table width="300" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align=center">

									<td align="left"><span class="setextcaption">Figure 15-21<br>About 180 million years ago, Pangaea split into northern and southern landmasses that later separated into the modern continents. India collided with Eurasia just 40&#150;50 million years ago, forming the Himalaya mountain range. The continents continue to drift today.</span></td>
								</tr>
						</table></p>

<p>The second major event in the history of continental drift was written about 180 million years ago as Pangaea began to break up. As the continents drifted apart, each became an isolated and separate evolutionary arena. The species living on the different continents would have diverged in their evolution as they continued to adapt and diversify on the now-separate continents.</p>
						
<p><span class="setextsub">Mass Extinctions</span><br> 
The fossil record reveals that Earth's history has long periods of relative stability broken by comparatively brief episodes of great species loss known as <a href="../../glossary/terms/m/gmassext.html" target="glossterm" onClick="openSmallerWindowglossterm('../../glossary/terms/m/gmassext.html');return false;" title="Launches glossary term pop-up">mass extinctions</a>. For example, at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 65 million years ago, the world lost an enormous number of species. Before then, dinosaurs had thrived on Earth for 150 million years. Less than 10 million years later&#151;a brief period in geologic time&#151;all the dinosaurs were gone. Scientists have been debating what happened for decades. The geologic record indicates a number of events that may have contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs. The climate was cooling, and shallow seas were receding. But perhaps the final blow left its mark near the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. There, buried beneath sediment, lies a huge crater caused by a large meteor that struck Earth. The timing of this impact corresponds with the last evidence of dinosaurs and many other species. Many scientists think that such a huge impact would have polluted the sky with dusty debris for months. (Rock layers from that time period contain evidence of this debris.) By blocking sunlight, this event would have reduced food production by photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Extinction is unavoidable in a changing world. While extinctions occur all the time, there have been five or six distinct periods of mass extinction over the last 600 million years. One example marks the end of the Permian period, when extinction claimed over 90 percent of the species of marine animals. Whatever their causes, mass extinctions greatly affect biological diversity. Yet, there is a positive side to this story. Each massive loss of species has been followed by adaptive radiation of some survivors. In the aftermath of mass extinctions, biological diversity gradually increased again. Mass extinctions provided the surviving organisms with new opportunities. For example, just after the mass extinction marking the end of the Cretaceous period, fossil evidence suggests that mammals underwent widespread adaptive radiation. The rise of mammals probably resulted, in part, from the void left by the extinction of dinosaurs.</p>
